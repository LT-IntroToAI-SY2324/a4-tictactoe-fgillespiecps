# Assignment 4 - Writeup

In assignment 4 we created a basic tic tac toe game so that we could learn object oriented programming. Respond to the following questions.

## Reflection Questions

1. What was the most difficult part to tic-tac-toe?
The most difficult part of this was understanding how the tests were completed and why they were important in order for the program to be successful.
2. Explain how you would add a computer player to the game.
You can add a computer to the game by making code for the computer to make a move on the board after the player makes their move. The game would end when the winner would get tictactoe. You could also alternate who starts so the computer can go first and then go after the player moves.
3. If you add a computer player, explain (doesn't have to be super technical) how you might get the computer player to play the best move every time. *Note - I am not grading this for a correct answer, I just want to know your thoughts on how you might accomplish it.
You can program the computer to make a specific move after every scenario. You can implement something like machine learning so the computer can go through and play against itself until it accomplishes going through every scenario and it plays the best move.
